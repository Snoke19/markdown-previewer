# Markdown Editor

A simple, responsive Markdown editor built with React, providing real-time Markdown preview and syntax highlighting. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), making it easy to develop, build, and deploy.

## Features
- **Real-time Markdown Preview**: See the output as you type.
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) Support**: Use tables, task lists, and more.
- **Syntax Highlighting for Code Blocks**: Highlight code using `highlight.js`.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Clean and Simple UI**: User-friendly interface for easy editing.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**  
This command allows you to take full control of the build tools, but it is not required for most users.
